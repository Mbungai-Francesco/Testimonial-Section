## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Instead of using css grid for this, I used css flexbox which was tougher but still really fun
Also to that this project helped me deeply work on responsiveness.


### Continued development

I'll be redoing this project with react and trying to add some animation to this either this version or the upcoming version.
### Useful resources

- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Helped with some css research
